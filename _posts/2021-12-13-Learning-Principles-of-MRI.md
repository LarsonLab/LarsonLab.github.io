I just completed teaching the course UCSF Biomedical Imaging 201: "Principles of MRI" for the 11th time, and figured it would be a great opportunity to share some of my experiences and materials.  If you just want the answers (TLDR), you can check out my lectures and course materials

## A course for engineers and non-engineers

The target audience of this course are students in the UCSF Masters of Science in Biomedical Imaging program that includes a broad range of backgrounds and aims to team the fundamental principles of biomedical imaging modalities as well as how imaging is used in clinical applications.

It does not require prerequisites in engineering or programming and the students come from varied backgrounds, mostly STEM, but only a fraction of them have background in engineering principles (e.g. signal processing, Fourier Transforms, scientific computing) and physics principles (particularly electricity and magnetism) that are often prerequisites for engineering-based MRI curriculum.  This is the primary challenge I have faced teaching this course.
