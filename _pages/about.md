Our research group takes an engineering-driven approach to develop advanced medical imaging methods, with most of our projects focusing on MRI although dabbling with CT and PET as well.  We have a broad range of projects, focusing on human or human-ready imaging technology, including
   * Metabolic MRI with hyperpolarized contrast agents
   * Simultaneous PET/MR imaging systems
   * Lung MRI
   * Myelin MRI
   * Radiation treatment planning
   * Prostate and kidney cancer prediction using deep learning

We use tools such as signal processing, optimization methods, signal modeling, statistical estimation, MRI scanner programming, and deep learning, and apply these methods for human studies in oncology, urology, pulmonology, cardiology and neurology. 

Our team is in Byers Hall at the UCSF Mission Bay campus, as a part of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) at UCSF.  The primary facilities available for research include 3T and 7T MRI systems, Hyperpolarizers, an electronics shop, and a machine shop, all of which are part of the Surbeck Laboratory for Advanced Imaging and are supported in part by the NIH-funded Hyperpolarized MRI Technology Resource Center.  We are also actively involved in development of technology for PET/MR systems, using the time-of-flight PET with 3-Tesla MRI at China Basin.
